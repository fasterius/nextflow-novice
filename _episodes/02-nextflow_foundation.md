# Nextflow foundation

This section describes how to write and run a nextflow workflow.

##Â Writing a workflow.

Nextflow workflows are written in the computer language Groovy.

A nextflow script has two main components, processes and channels.

Example (`example.nf`
```nextflow
#! /usr/bin/env nextflow

number_ch = Channel.from(1,2,3,4)

process echo {

    input:
    val number from number_ch

    output:
    stdout into out_ch

    script:
    """
    echo "Number: $number"
    """

}

out_ch.view()
```

A Channel is a structure that passes data asynchronously from one process to another.

A process is a task that executes on a single input set.

## Running a workflow.

```bash
$ nextflow run test.nf

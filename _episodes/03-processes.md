## Processes

Processes are the Nextflow data structure used to run user scripts.
The default script language is assumed to be Bash script, but
scripts can be written in any interpreted language, e.g. R, python,
or perl.

## The process data structure

A process has five parts:

- Directives: Defines configuration properties
- Input: Defines the input
- Output: Defines the output
- When: Defines when the process should execute (default: true = always when input is available)
- Script: Defines the script to run.

~~~
process < name > {

   [ directives ]

   input:
    < process inputs >

   output:
    < process outputs >

   when:
    < condition >

   [script|shell|exec]:
   < user script to be executed >

}
~~~
{: .source}

The user script is the only required part of the process that needs to be defined. 

## Isolated run folder

Each instance of a process is staged in it's own folder.

Example script:
~~~
x = Channel.from( 'a', 'b', 'c')

process echo_string {

    input:
    val x

    script:
    """
    echo "string-$x"
    """

}

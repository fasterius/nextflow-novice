<h2>Overview</h2>

Nextflow is a workflow manager rapidly increasing in popularity in the scientific community.
The framework allows scientists to integrate code from any language, separate functional logic 
from the execution engine, encapsulate software dependencies, and simplify analyses into readable, 
contained, easy to reproduce projects. It enables high-throughput and data intensive analyses to 
be run locally, or across grid or cloud infrastructures.

<h2>Goal</h2>

The goal of this lesson is to teach scientists with little programming skill to use and write
nextflow workflows for scientific analysis. The emphasis of these materials is to provide
a foundation in the fundamentals of Nextflow, and teach best practices for scientific computing:
breaking down analyses into modular units, testing, and encapsulation. 

Additional material may be provided later for more advanced users.
